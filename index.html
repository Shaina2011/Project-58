    <p>Reading is my hobby. I love to read because I learn new things, learn new words and imagine more. I always want to know what happens next in the story. My favourite book series are Harry Potter, Geronimo Stilton and Thea Stilton. I like to read anytime mostly when I have free time. It is always so exciting to read new and old books. I think reading gives us knowledge and helps us learn but while reading books we also have fun!</p>
